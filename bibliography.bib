abstract = "Big data processing systems are characterized by a relevant number of components that are used in parallel to run multiple instances of the same tasks in order to achieve the needed performance levels in applications characterized by huge amounts of data. Such a number of components depend on the dimension of the involved data, so that new resources (e.g., processing or storage servers) are usually added as the working database grows. A reliable performance evaluation of these systems is at the same time crucial, in order to enable administrators and developers to keep the pace with data growth, and extremely difficult, due to the intrinsic complexity of these architectures. Notwithstanding, the available literature does not yet offer sufficient experiences, nor significant methodologies, in such a direction. This paper presents a novel modeling approach, based on mean field analysis, a set of methods for approximate inference of probabilistic models, derived from statistical physics, for performance evaluation of big data systems. This approach, by containing the excessive state space growth characterizing more traditional modeling methodologies, also requires a significantly reduced effort with respect to simulation based ones."

abstract = "Grids consist of both dedicated and non-dedicated clusters. For effective mapping of parallel applications on grid resources, a grid metascheduler has to evaluate different sets of resources in terms of predicted execution times for the applications when executed on the sets of resources. In this work, we have developed a comprehensive set of performance modeling strategies for predicting execution times of parallel applications on both dedicated and non-dedicated environments. Our strategies adapt to changing network and CPU loads on the grid resources. We have evaluated our strategies on 8, 16, 24 and 32-node clusters with random loads and load traces from a grid system. Our strategies give less than 30\% average percentage prediction errors in all cases, which, to our knowledge, is the best reported for non-dedicated environments. We also found that grid scheduling using predictions of execution times from our performance modeling techniques will lead to perfect mapping of applications to resources in many cases."

We propose a graph model to describe application program behavior. In order to precisely abstract an architecture model for the prediction, important and implicit architecture parameters are obtained by experiments. We focus on performance predictions of application programs in shared-memory and data-parallel architectures. Real world applications are implemented using the shared-memory model on the KSR-1 and using the data-parallel model on the CM-5 for performance measurements and prediction validation. We show that experimental measurements provide strong support for performance predictions on multiprocessors with implicit communications and complex memory systems, such as shared-memory and data-parallel systems, while analytical techniques partially applied in the prediction significantly reduce computer simulation and measurement time."
